/**
 * File: AssignmentPart2.java
 * Solution for the task of building columns using beepers.
 * Karel moves along the southern edge between columns and processes
 * each column twice â€” going up to build it, then returning down.
 * Prerequisites:
 * - Karel starts in the southwest corner, facing East.
 * - Karel's backpack is full of beepers.
 * - Columns (walls) are placed every 4th cell, starting from the east wall.
 * - Map ends with column on the East side.
 * - No isolated walls (all connected to building).
 * - The first southern row contains no walls.
 * Result:
 * - Each column has a complete row of beepers underneath it.
 * - Karel located in the last cell on the south side, facing South.
* */
